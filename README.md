    PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
* I made the user interface and added a movie API
to showcase that I fully understand how ReactJS, HTML and CSS can be used alongside an API

* clicking on any movie image will redirect to a link to the imdb website


       RESOURCES USED:
sending api requests
//http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=[yourkey]&
//http://www.omdbapi.com/?s=${searchValue}&apikey={process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY}
fetch ( `  https://www.omdbapi.com/?s=${searchValue}&apikey={api key numbers} )
http://www.omdbapi.com/?s=${searchValue}&apikey=${process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY}


https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch
* The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline,
 such as requests and responses. It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy,
  logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.
