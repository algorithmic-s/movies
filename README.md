    PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
* I made the user interface and added a movie API
to showcase that I fully understand how ReactJS, HTML and CSS can be used alongside an API

* clicking on any movie image will redirect to a link to the imdb website


       RESOURCES USED:
* sending api requests: www. omdbapi.com

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch
* The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline,
 such as requests and responses. It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy,
  logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.
