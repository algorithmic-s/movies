* I made the user interface and added a movie API
to showcase that I fully understand how ReactJS, HTML and CSS can be used alongside an API

* clicking on any movie image will redirect to a link to the imdb website


    RESOURCES USED:
sending api requests
//http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=[yourkey]&
//http://www.omdbapi.com/?s=${searchValue}&apikey={process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY}
fetch ( `  https://www.omdbapi.com/?s=${searchValue}&apikey={api key numbers} )
http://www.omdbapi.com/?s=${searchValue}&apikey=${process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY}


https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch
* The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline,
 such as requests and responses. It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy,
  logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.















































My comments:
I've learned that javascript combined with ReactJS is a powerful and potent tool to create web applications, websites
and other projects that could be used to improve the inner workings of organizations in maintaining, creating, 
and managing information.

Since the last three weeks this summer (2020) I've gained a relevant understanding of javascript and JS frameworks.
I've thought of several ideas of applications and learned the inner workings of the tools through
following tutorials, articles and self-help guidebooks in the form of textbooks.
